    "text": "üç™ Template demo\n\nWe‚Äôll now give a short demo of how the cookiecutter template can be used by researchers to quickly create a Python package which integrates lots of elements of good practice in creating sustainable research software such as use of Git for version control, automated testing and linting and a documentation website.\nTo create an instance of template you will need to first install the cookiecutter package (for example using conda) and then run\ncookiecutter gh:ucl-arc/python-tooling\n(Briefly explain prompts, using default options other than\n[4/14] Name of project: Festival of DRS demo\n[9/14] Automatically deploy HTML docs?: Y\n[10/14] GitHub owner: UCL-ARC\nfor later commands and links to work)\nYou will then get some helpful output telling you to run\ngh repo create UCL-ARC/festival-of-drs-demo -d 'A cookiecutter package with UCL ARC recommendations.' --public -r origin --source festival-of-drs-demo\nto create a repository on GitHub for the project if you have the GitHub command line interface installed.\nAs we selected to deploy the documentation to GitHub pages we are also told some further configuration to the repository we need to do, namely to go to\nhttps://github.com/UCL-ARC/festival-of-drs-demo/settings/actions\nand set Workflow permissions to Read and write permissions\nOnce we have done that we can then make an initial commit and push to our newly created repository on GitHub\ncd festival-of-drs-demo\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit\"\ngit push --set-upstream origin main\nIf we now go to\nhttps://github.com/UCL-ARC/festival-of-drs-demo/\nwe can see the repository is now populated with a README with some default content such as the project description, details of the project team, instructions for installing the package, running the tests and building the documentation locally (navigate to each of these sections in README). Using GitHub‚Äôs Citation File Format support we also have an easy way to automatically generate a citation for the repository (demo ‚ÄòCite this repository‚Äô button ).\nThe repository has also been set up with automated workflows for running tests, performing linting static analysis checks on the source code and building the documentation the status of which we can see from the badges on README page (show badges) or by going to the Actions pane\nhttps://github.com/UCL-ARC/python-tooling/actions\n(Wait for Documentation workflow to complete to ensure gh-pages branch has been created and pushed to.)\nTo enable the GitHub Page website for the repository there is one final step we need to do that is also printed in the message output by the cookiecutter command, which is to go to the settings page at\nhttps://github.com/UCL-ARC/festival-of-drs-demo/settings/pages\nand under ‚ÄòBuilt and deployment‚Äô selecting ‚ÄòDeploy from a branch‚Äô for the ‚ÄòSource‚Äô drop-down and ‚Äògh-pages‚Äô for the ‚ÄòBranch‚Äô drop-down, leaving the branch path drop-down with its default value of ‚Äò/ (root)‚Äô.\nOnce the documentation deploy action has finished running\nhttps://github.com/UCL-ARC/python-tooling/actions\n(Wait for pages-build-deployment action to complete)\nthe documentation can then be viewed at\nhttps://github-pages.arc.ucl.ac.uk/festival-of-drs-demo\nThe documentation site homepage is automatically set up to show the content from the repository README. Importantly however we also get automatically generated API documentation from the docstrings in the source code (go to API reference page). The project LICENSE is also displayed in documentation (go to License page)."
